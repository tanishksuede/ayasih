# Supabase Migration Guide

We need to connect your new `ayadevlink` codebase and your Vercel deployment to the new Supabase project.

Follow these steps carefully:

## 1. Set Up the Database Schema
I have combined all of our database tables, policies, and RPC functions into a single file.
1. Open your new Supabase project dashboard.
2. Go to the **SQL Editor** (the `</>` icon on the left).
3. Click **New Query**.
4. Open the file `c:\ayadevlink\full_schema.sql` on your computer, copy **all** of its contents, and paste it into the SQL Editor.
5. Click **Run** to execute it. This will instantly create all the necessary tables!

## 2. Connect Your Local Code
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** (gear icon) -> **API**.
2. Copy the **Project URL** and the **anon (public)** key.
3. Open `c:\ayadevlink\.env` (or create a `.env.local` file).
4. Update the values to match your new project:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_new_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key
   ```

## 3. Re-Enable Google Login (Important!)
Since this is a new project, you have to enable Google Auth again.
1. Go to **Authentication** -> **Providers** -> **Google**.
2. Turn it on.
3. You will need your Google Client ID and Google Client Secret (you can copy these from your old Supabase project's settings if you still have them, or from Google Cloud Console).
4. Save the settings.

## 4. Update Vercel
Your live website is currently still talking to the old Supabase project!
1. Go to your **Vercel Dashboard**.
2. Select your `aya-weld` project.
3. Go to **Settings** -> **Environment Variables**.
4. Edit `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to match the new project keys.
5. Go to **Deployments** and click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment so it picks up the new keys.
