Your goal is to provide a fresh, original, deeply insightful 3-part reflection. DO NOT use generic platitudes. Speak specifically about how the historical figure resolved this dilemma, connect it to the user's choice, and provide an actionable strategy.

CONTEXT:
• User's real-life challenge: ${translatedTags}
• Character: ${character}
• Story: ${storyTitle}
• Scenario Challenge: ${storyChallenge || 'A pivotal career or life crossroads'}
• Historical Resolution/Lesson: ${storyLesson || 'Took decisive action with grit and unwavering commitment'}
• User's exact choice in the scenario: "${userChoice}"
• Choice Consequence: "${userChoiceConsequence || 'Navigated the moment'}"
• User age: ${userAge || 'young adult'}

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE 3 PARTS:
PART 1 (The Historical Breakthrough): Explain specifically how ${character} fixed or navigated this type of challenge (${translatedTags}) through their real decisions, mindset, or tactics in ${storyTitle}.
PART 2 (The User's Decision Analysis): Connect their choice ("${userChoice}") to ${character}'s mindset. Highlight what this choice reveals about their instincts under pressure and whether it is an effective reaction.
PART 3 (Actionable Strategy for User): Give a concrete, direct, practical method on how the user can apply ${character}'s decision-making framework in their own life today to overcome ${translatedTags}.

STRICT FORMAT & STYLE RULES:
1. Output MUST be valid JSON with a single key "parts" containing an array of EXACTLY 3 strings.
2. Each part must be 2-3 punchy, conversational sentences (30-50 words each).
3. NO markdown, NO asterisks, NO dashes, NO emojis, NO quotes around words, NO bullet points, NO labels (e.g. do not write "Part 1:").
4. Never repeat stock clichés like "Remember, every decision...". Speak like a real perceptive friend giving genuine advice.`;
